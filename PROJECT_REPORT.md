# Project Report: Fitness Tracking Application

## Project Overview
This project is a personal fitness tracking web application designed to help users monitor their workouts, diet plans, health metrics, and goals. It features a modern frontend built with React and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and uses Vite as the build tool. The backend is implemented with Node.js and TypeScript.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js, TypeScript
- **Build Tools:** Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend
- **Deployment:** Netlify for frontend static hosting

## Project Structure
- `client/`: Contains the React frontend source code, including components, pages, hooks, and styles.
- `server/`: Contains backend server code and API routes.
- `shared/`: Shared schema and types used across client and server.
- Configuration files for TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite, and build scripts are located at the root.

## Build and Deployment Setup
- The Vite configuration (`vite.config.ts`) sets the base path to relative (`'./'`) and outputs the build to `dist/public`.
- The build process generates static assets and an `index.html` file in `dist/public`.
- Deployment to Netlify requires setting the publish directory to `dist/public`.
- A `_redirects` file was added to `dist/public` with the rule `/* /index.html 200` to enable SPA routing on Netlify and prevent "page not found" errors.

## Fixes and Improvements
- **Netlify SPA Routing Fix:** Created the `_redirects` file to handle client-side routing correctly on Netlify.
- **Favicon Issue:** Identified missing `favicon.svg` referenced in `index.html`. Provided guidance to add a simple favicon SVG file to avoid 404 errors without changing site design.
- Verified build output paths and asset references to ensure compatibility with Netlify deployment.

## Testing and Verification
- Confirmed successful build with `npm run build` generating expected files in `dist/public`.
- Tested local opening of `index.html` and verified asset loading.
- Guided critical-path testing on Netlify deployment to verify home page and internal routes load without errors.
- Advised checking browser console for missing asset errors and fixing favicon reference.
